                        I graduated summa cum laude from DePaul University with a major in Health Sciences. I was on the track to medical school. However, even after receiving the highest recommendation for medical school from the Pre-Health Committee at DePaul University, achieving my goal score on the MCAT, and having medical experience, I came to realize that pursing the physician career was not for me. I am still very much interested in the healthcare industry, and I am currently working in the Center for Innovative Global Health Technologies at Northwestern University. At Northwestern, I became fascinated with coding and web development, and I decided to pursue a certificate from Northwestern University in web development and coding. I am pursing careers where I can use my critical thinking/analytical skills and my people skills to help create a positive impact. Although I am no longer interested in becoming a physician, I still am very passionate about creating positive changes in people's lives.
